# Music Thing

I'm trying to make videos like this https://www.tiktok.com/@jb.reddit

I've seen many others like it on TikTok by other creators.

Still WIP - just getting started.

I don't know why I'm so obsessed with replicating these videos right now.

I'll prob give this a few more hours over the next couple of weeks and then move on to something else.

If anyone already knows of an open source repo that makes these videos already, please let me know.

# How to Run

1. Install the "soundfont" file found here: https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/98376-recommended-soundfonts/?tab=comments#comment-1827928)
2. Save it to "assets/soundfont.sf2"
2. Create Virtualenv, install deps, and run the code

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```
